# Iris Dataset Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a machine learning model to predict the species of flowers in the Iris dataset. The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used to classify the flowers into three species.

---

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each containing 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label representing the species. There are three target classes:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

### Key Features

- **Number of Samples**: 150
- **Number of Features**: 4
- **Target Classes**: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn and optionally from CSV using pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize feature distributions, relationships between features, and perform statistical analysis.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Standardize or normalize features using techniques like StandardScaler for improved model performance.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Choose a classification model such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, or KNN.
   - Train the model using the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions about the species for new input samples based on the trained model.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to understand feature importance, model performance, and the decision boundaries.
