# Task 2: Simple Linear Regression Model

This repository implements a simple Linear Regression model using Python to predict a numerical value (salary) based on a single feature (years of experience) in the `Experience-Salary.csv` dataset.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x with necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

**Deliverables:**

* `linear_regression.py` (or a similar filename): Python script demonstrating the implementation.
* `model_performance_summary.txt` (or a similar filename): Text file summarizing model performance metrics.
* Visualization (e.g., `regression_plot.png`): Plot of the regression line with data points.

**Dataset**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saquib7hussain/experience-salary-dataset
**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository or download the contents.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`.
3. Run the script: `python linear_regression.py`.
4. The script will:
   * Import necessary libraries.
   * Load the dataset from `Experience-Salary.csv`.
   * Preprocess the data (optional, based on data quality).
   * Split the data into training and testing sets.
   * Create and train a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
   * Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
   * Print the model's coefficients (intercept and slope).
   * Generate a visualization of the regression line with data points.
5. The output will include model performance metrics and a visualization saved as a separate file.

**Model Performance Summary:**

The performance of the model is summarized in the `model_performance_summary.txt` file (or a similar filename) generated by the script. It typically contains metrics like:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R-squared (R2)
* Intercept
* Coefficient
